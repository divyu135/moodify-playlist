# Moodify : Lets moodify your playlist

Moodify is a web application developed using Flask for backend and ReactJS for frontend. We have used MongoDB to handle unstictured data of songs, lyrics and images. We are also using relational database to handle user authetications.

## Overview

Music can evoke powerful emotional reponses such as chills and thrills in listeners. Postive emotions dominate musical experiences and helps to release stress and negativity in life. Our application will allow users to connect to music emotionally and will help to eradicate all the negative and stressfull thoughts. So, the main aim of the project is to create an Application that will determine the mood of users based on user inputs and fetches a list of songs and displays it as a playlist based on the determined mood.
